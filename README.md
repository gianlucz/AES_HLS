# AES block cipher with Vivado HLS
Project milestones:
- Create a standard C-compliant AES implementation to use as a reference
- Make the reference C code compatile ewith HLS synthesizer
- Implement HLS-specific optimizations
- Evaluate performances

Based on https://github.com/secworks/aes implementation.
